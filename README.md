# portfolio-frontEnd
App Dev

This repository contains the frontend implementation for the portfolio application, built using React Native with Expo. The app displays categorized links from the backend, including sections like portfolio, real estate, more about me, and contact. Each page fetches and displays data relevant to its category using React Query for data fetching.

To get started, install the dependencies with npm install and run the application using expo start. Ensure your backend server is running and the API endpoints are correctly set in the environment variables. The app is designed to be user-friendly and provides an intuitive interface for users to explore different sections of the portfolio.
